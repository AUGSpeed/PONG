# PONG
A recreation of the Atari classic, PONG, in Java. Made by AUGSpeed, Theo, and Shem. Made with the help of a tutorial from Jad Bodnar.

This is the PONG game and code seen in the video made by AUGSpeed, so if you would like to play around with it and do crazy things, here you go!

All Open source and ready to be messed with! Figure out how things work, and change numbers, that's how I started learning how to program.
